## Project Background and Overview
---
OnyX Coffee, established in 2018, is a South Africa-based company that sells coffee in three countries: South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. 
The company has a significant amount of data on its sales, product offerings, and loyalty program, which has been previously underutilized. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this data to uncover insights that will enhance OnyX’s profitability and commercial success. 

The goal of this data analysis project is to give the head of operations at OnyX Coffee useful information based on the company's current sales, product, and loyalty program data. The main goal is to provide answers to important strategic questions so that the leadership team can make well-informed decisions that will increase profitability and lead to better commercial success. 
The following primary topics of inquiry will be addressed by the project's thorough investigation of the data that is already available:


Leveraging an SQL database and Power BI, this project will deliver actionable insights by analyzing OnyX Coffee's data to address the following key areas:

1.  **Top Customer Analysis (SQL & Power BI):** Identify, characterize, and rank the top ten customers based on their total purchase value (derived via SQL queries) and loyalty program participation (queried from SQL). Power BI will then visualize these top customers and the effectiveness of the loyalty program in engaging them.
2.  **Loyalty Program Adoption Rate (SQL & Power BI):** Calculate the total number of customers enrolled in the loyalty program (using SQL queries). Power BI will display this as a percentage of the overall customer base, illustrating the program's reach.
3.  **Geographic Customer Segmentation (SQL & Power BI):** Determine the number of customers originating from South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana (through SQL filtering). Power BI will present this data visually, highlighting regional customer concentration.
4.  **Product Profitability Analysis (SQL & Power BI):** Calculate the profit margin for each OnyX Coffee product (requiring SQL joins between sales and cost data). Power BI will then rank products by profitability, enabling identification of top and bottom performers.
5.  **High-Revenue, High-Profit Products (SQL & Power BI):** Identify products that exceed a defined threshold for both total revenue (calculated in SQL) and profit margin (calculated in SQL). Power BI will showcase these key products driving financial success.
6.  **Coffee Bean Type Performance (SQL & Power BI):** Analyze the total revenue and profit generated by each unique coffee bean type sold by OnyX (requiring SQL aggregation and joins). Power BI will visualize the performance of different bean types.
7.  **Roast Preference Analysis (SQL & Power BI):** Determine the total sales volume for each coffee roast type (light, medium, dark) using SQL aggregation. Power BI will display the dominant roast preference based on sales volume.
8.  **Product Distribution and Country-Specific Sales (SQL & Power BI):** Analyze the volume of orders and total sales for each coffee bean product within South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana (using SQL filtering and aggregation). Power BI will present country-specific product performance.
9.  **Country-Specific Financial Performance (SQL & Power BI):** Calculate the total revenue and profit generated within each operating country (using SQL filtering and aggregation). Power BI will clearly display the financial contribution of each market.
10. **Top Products by Country (SQL & Power BI):** Identify the best-selling product within each of the three countries based on sales volume (using SQL window functions or grouped queries). Power BI will highlight market-specific product preferences.
11. **Country-Specific Bean Type Performance (SQL & Power BI):** Analyze the revenue and profit generated by each coffee bean type within each country (requiring detailed SQL filtering and aggregation). Power BI will provide a granular view of bean preferences and profitability by market.
12. **Top South African Cities for Sales (SQL & Power BI):** Identify the top 5 South African cities based on the total sales volume of coffee beans (requiring SQL filtering for South Africa and grouping by city). Power BI will visualize these top-performing cities within the domestic market.
13. **Historical Annual Revenue Trends (SQL & Power BI):** Extract and aggregate the total revenue for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2024 (using SQL date functions and aggregation). Power BI will display the company's annual revenue growth trend over the past six years.
14. **Historical Monthly Revenue Trends (SQL & Power BI):** Extract and aggregate the monthly revenue data for the past six years (2019-2024) using SQL date functions and aggregation. Power BI will visualize monthly revenue trends to identify potential seasonality.

Through SQL queries to extract and transform the necessary data and Power BI dashboards to visualize these insights, this project aims to empower OnyX Coffee with a data-driven understanding of their customers, products, and market performance across Southern Africa. This will facilitate informed decisions to enhance customer engagement, optimize operations, and ultimately drive profitability and sustainable growth.

## Executive Summary
---
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of OnyX Coffee's sales, product, and customer loyalty data to provide actionable insights for enhancing profitability and commercial success.  The analysis covers key areas such as customer loyalty, product performance, and geographical distribution.  Key findings include that Liberica coffee beans are the most profitable, light roast is the most popular roast type, and South Africa is the primary market.  The analysis also indicates that only 51% of customers are enrolled in the loyalty program, with 60% of the top ten customers being members.  Recommendations focus on leveraging these insights to improve customer engagement, product strategy, and market penetration. 

## Insights Deep-Dive
---
 **1. Customer Identification and Loyalty:** 
 
Who are the 10 best customers? Are they loyalty members?

```sql
SELECT orders.customer_id, customers.customer_name,  customers.loyalty_card, SUM(Quantity) AS quantity_purchased,
ROUND(SUM((orders.Quantity * products.unit_price)), 2) AS money_spent
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY orders.customer_id, customers.customer_name, customers.loyalty_card
ORDER BY money_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

![Q1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5c9daed-ce9f-4ab5-9a73-fa41e7ef5367)

According to customer sales, these are the top ten clients.  According to the table, just 60% of the top ten customers hold loyalty cards.

 **2. Loyalty Program Penetration:** 

How many customers have loyalty cards?

 ```sql
SELECT loyalty_card, COUNT(loyalty_card) AS Count 
FROM customers
GROUP BY loyalty_card;
```
![Q2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9c350d-106f-4f8d-b611-9b80db5c5f6c)

Fifty-one percent of consumers possess loyalty cards, while forty-nine percent do not.  It's interesting that, out of the top 10 customers on the list, only 60% had loyalty cards, although 51% of all customers had them.  Customers that purchase more goods from a business are typically more likely to become members.

 **3. Geographic Customer Distribution:** 

  How many customers are from each country?

 ```sql
SELECT customers.country, COUNT(DISTINCT customers.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY customers.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
```
![Q3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93ded8f-64f9-4a51-bd72-1901260002d1)

70% of the clients are from South Africa, making them the largest group.

 **4. Product Profitability Analysis:** 

Which product has the largest and the lowest profit margins?

  ```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE profit = (SELECT Max(profit) FROM products) OR profit = (SELECT Min(profit) FROM products);
```
![Q4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b0e6e6-f042-4ed4-af32-f36e73bea49f)

Robusta Dark Roast (0.2 kg) has the lowest profit margin of any coffee bean commodity, at ZAR 0.16, while Liberica Light Roast (2.5 kg) has the largest profit margin, at ZAR 4.74.

 **5. High-Performing Products:** 

Products that have the highest profit margins and revenue.

  ```sql
SELECT orders.product_id, products.coffee_type, products.roast_type, products.Size,
ROUND(SUM((orders.quantity * products.unit_price)), 2) AS Revenue,
ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.profit), 2) AS profit
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY orders.product_id, products.coffee_type, products.roast_type, products.Size
ORDER BY profit DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
![Q5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14dc6cf-7afe-412f-811f-2d67aedb78b5)

Size 2.5 is the largest size that OnyX Coffee sells, and it makes up the majority of their coffee bean goods.  This suggests that the corporation often makes more money when selling larger quantities of the different kinds of coffee beans.  This makes sense because larger products sell more even though their production costs are probably just somewhat higher.

 **6. Coffee Bean Type Performance:** 

What is the revenue and profit for each coffee bean type?

  ```sql
SELECT products.coffee_type, ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.unit_price), 2) AS Revenue,
ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.profit), 2) AS profit
From orders
LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY products.coffee_type
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```
![Q6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ff1448b-5574-487a-8e4f-f24ea54b6d09)

Liberica coffee beans are the most profitable, which suggests that their sales are higher.  Customers place larger orders for Liberica coffee beans as a result, increasing their profit margin.  This indicates that selling Liberica coffee beans is more profitable for the business, therefore they may concentrate their marketing efforts on increasing sales of these beans.

 **7. Roast Preference Analysis:** 

What type of roast generate the most sales?

  ```sql
SELECT products.roast_type, ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.unit_price), 2) AS Revenue
From orders
LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY products.roast_type
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```
![Q7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d2b216f-d65e-4a97-9d01-e3abb3ffba9b)

With ZAR 1,113,800.03 in revenue, light roast is the most popular roast for The Roasters coffee beans.

 **8. Product Distribution and Country-Specific Sales:** 

Quantity sold and Number of Orders By Country

  ```sql
SELECT customers.country, SUM(orders.quantity) AS quantity_sold, COUNT(DISTINCT orders.customer_id) AS orders
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.country
ORDER BY quantity_sold DESC;
```
![Q8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e67ba21-c212-4df7-96e5-86a69c6c7b0c)

South Africa accounts for the majority of orders.

 **9. Country-Specific Financial Performance:** 

Profit and Revenue Per Country

  ```sql
SELECT customers.country, ROUND(SUM((orders.quantity * products.unit_price)), 2) AS Revenue,
ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.profit), 2) AS Profit
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY customers.country;
```
![Q9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2700f9a6-519c-4a38-b7d5-07a82b851252)

It should come as no surprise that South African clients are OnyX Coffee's primary source of income and profit given the volume of orders .

 **10. Top Products by Country:** 

What product is most popular in each country?

  ```sql
WITH coffee_type AS (
	SELECT customers.country, products.coffee_type, products.roast_type, products.Size, SUM(quantity) AS Quantity_Sold
	FROM orders
	LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
	LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
	GROUP BY customers.country, products.coffee_type, products.roast_type, products.size
),
quant_rank AS (
	SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY Quantity_Sold DESC) AS q_rank
    FROM coffee_type
)
SELECT country, coffee_type, roast_type, size, Quantity_Sold
FROM quant_rank
WHERE q_rank = 1
ORDER BY Quantity_Sold DESC;
```

![Q10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06ea60e-0a0b-480c-91e1-33ef68d9c473)

Robusta medium roast (0.2 kg) was the most favoured product among South African consumers.  Robusta dark roast (0.5 kg) was the most preferred among Botswana's customers.  Arabica medium roast (0.5 kg) was the most widely consumed type in Namibia.

 **11. Country-Specific Bean Type Performance:** 

What is the revenue and profit of each type of coffee bean for each country?

  ```sql
WITH coffee_sold AS (
 SELECT customers.country, ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.unit_price), 2) AS Revenue, products.coffee_type
 FROM orders
 LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
 LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
 GROUP BY customers.country, products.coffee_type
),
coffee_ranks AS (
  SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY Revenue DESC) AS coffee_rank
        FROM coffee_sold
)
SELECT coffee_type, country, Revenue
FROM coffee_ranks
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```
![Q11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0001724-ca0f-4c98-8d18-34ccf161d5b5)

According to the table, coffee bean varieties are preferred differently in each nation.  Liberica coffee beans generated the most money for South African consumers, totalling ZAR 613,583.51.

Liberica coffee beans were also the biggest source of income for Botswana's consumers, bringing in ZAR 179,031.14.

With ZAR 82,939.10, Excelsa coffee beans were the biggest source of income for Namibian consumers.

 **12. Top South African Cities for Sales:** 

What are the top 5 cities in South Africa for coffee bean sales?

  ```sql
SELECT customers.city, customers.country, SUM(orders.quantity) as Quantity_Sold, 
ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.unit_price), 2) AS Sales
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
WHERE customers.country = 'South Africa'
GROUP BY customers.country, customers.city

LIMIT 5;
```
![Q12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23135d42-a7ab-4bb1-b066-c180db55fe66)

According to the list, Cape Town and Johannesburg lead the Roasters in coffee bean sales.  Given that both cities rank among the nation's two largest and most urbanised, this is not surprising.   In large cities, more people drink coffee.

 **13. Historical Annual Revenue Trends:** 

  ```sql
SELECT YEAR(orders.order_date) AS Years,
ROUND(SUM(orders.quantity * products.unit_price), 2) AS Revenue
From orders
LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY Years
ORDER BY Years ASC;
```

![Q13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3ff38fb-4702-4ce0-a3b5-f69b9284a0ca)

Overall, total sales have shown a gradual increase from ZAR 493,447 in 2019 to ZAR 500,853 in 2024.

 **14. Historical Monthly Revenue Trends:** 

How much revenue did we make each month in the last 6 years (2019 to 2024)
